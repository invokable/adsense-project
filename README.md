# Laravel Console Starter

A streamlined Laravel starter kit for building applications with custom artisan commands.

This starter kit accelerates the development of Laravel applications that primarily use artisan commands for their functionality. Instead of building standalone CLI tools, you create powerful Laravel console applications that leverage the full Laravel framework ecosystem - including dependency injection, notifications, scheduling, and testing tools. Perfect for building scheduled tasks, data processing workflows, monitoring scripts, and automated maintenance tools that benefit from Laravel's robust architecture without the web application overhead.

> **Note:** If you would like to create a console only project based on the latest official Laravel skeleton, you can also use the [laravel-slim](https://github.com/invokable/laravel-slim) package.


## Key Features
- **Focus on Console Applications:** Streamlined for building Laravel applications with artisan commands, removing web-specific overhead.
- **Artisan Command Ready:** Quickly generate and organize your console commands using `php artisan make:command`.
- **Scheduled Tasks with GitHub Actions:** Includes a pre-configured example (`.github/workflows/cron.yml`) for running your commands on a schedule using GitHub Actions.
- **Laravel Framework Power:** Leverage familiar Laravel features like its robust dependency injection container, event system, configuration management, and application testing tools for your console applications.

## Requirements
- PHP ^8.2
- Laravel Framework ^12.0
- Laravel Installer ^5.14

## Installation

```shell
laravel new --using=revolution/laravel-console-starter --no-interaction my-app
```

## Usage

### Make a new command

```shell
php artisan make:command Hello --command=hello
```
This will create a new command class in `app/Console/Commands/Hello.php`. The `--command=hello` option sets the invokable name of your command, so you can run it later using `php artisan hello`.

### Task Scheduling in GitHub Actions

[cron.yml](./.github/workflows/cron.yml) is an example of how to run the command in GitHub Actions.
This workflow file demonstrates how to set up a cron-like schedule to execute your Artisan commands automatically. You'll need to customize it with the specific commands you want to run and their desired frequency. Remember to configure repository secrets for any sensitive information your commands might need (e.g., API keys, database credentials).

### Database

While console applications may not frequently use local databases, it's common to utilize remote databases like AWS RDS when running them in GitHub Actions. Database connection settings should be configured using secrets.

Example of environment variable configuration in a workflow:

```yaml
      - name: Run Command
        run: php artisan inspire
        env:
          APP_KEY: ${{ secrets.APP_KEY }}
          DB_HOST: ${{ secrets.DB_HOST }}
          DB_DATABASE: ${{ secrets.DB_DATABASE }}
          DB_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.DB_USERNAME }}
          DB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}
```

## Notifications

Laravel's built-in notification system provides a convenient way to send notifications from your console commands. This is particularly useful for:

-   Alerting you when a long-running task completes.
-   Reporting errors or issues encountered during command execution.
-   Sending updates or summaries to email, Slack, or other chat platforms.

To use this feature, you'll typically create a notification class (e.g., using `php artisan make:notification TaskCompleted`) and then send it using the `Notification` facade. You will need to configure your desired notification channels (like mail, Slack, etc.) in your Laravel application. When configuring notification channels, especially those relying on external services or specific mail drivers, you may need to publish the relevant configuration files if they don't already exist in your `config` directory. You can do this using the following Artisan commands:

```shell
php artisan config:publish mail
php artisan config:publish services
```

The `config/mail.php` file allows you to configure your mailer settings, while `config/services.php` is used to store credentials and settings for various third-party services that Laravel can integrate with for notifications (e.g., Slack, Vonage). For detailed setup and usage, please refer to the official [Laravel Notification documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications).
